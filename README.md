# web-development-journey
This repository represents 3 months of my time dedicated in learning web development. This course is taught by Angela Yu on Udemy

Technologies that I have learned on this course: 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* DOM Manipulation
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Node Js
* Express Js
* SQL basics
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Git, Github, and Version Control
* EJS
* RESTful API
* Authentication and Security
* React js

In addition, I have also done an extra course, [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ziwei/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures), offered by FreeCodeCamp. This allowed me to further develop my understanding in Javascript and general programming skills.
